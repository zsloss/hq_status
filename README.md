## Documentation Task Manager

This interactive task manager is designed for my current job, to manage a sortable todo list of documentation tasks. This includes current tasks, peer reviews, and a list of completed tasks (in case any of these need to be resurrected later). Administrator accounts can view and edit all users and their tasks via the **User Admin** and **Task Admin** pages.
